# PyPo

🐍 Python + 🏃🏻‍♂️ Expo

tl;dr: 
This project started out as the official [FastAPI project template](https://github.com/fastapi/full-stack-fastapi-template) + [Infinite Red's ignite Expo boilerplate](https://github.com/infinitered/ignite/) plus my own choices for building a cross language React Native app. 

## What is in this project?

Basically I took Fast API Template and replaced the included frontend with Infinite Red's expo boilerplate.

I added the OpenAPI Typescript client such that all data (user data, and item data) are loaded via hook using the OpenAPI generated hooks. And the OpenAPI generated React Query client.


# Pypo - Turborepo

This is a monorepo containing both the backend API and the Expo mobile application.

## Structure

```
pypo/
├── app/
│   ├── backend/     # FastAPI backend
│   └── expo/        # Expo React Native app
├── turbo.json       # Turborepo configuration
└── package.json     # Root workspace configuration
```

## Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 20.0.0
- Bun (package manager)
- Python 3.10+
- uv (Python package manager)

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

2. Install Python dependencies for the backend:
   ```bash
   cd app/backend
   uv sync
   ```

3. Start development servers:
   ```bash
   # Start both backend and expo
   bun run dev
   
   # Or start individually
   bun run dev --filter=backend
   bun run dev --filter=expo
   ```

## Available Scripts

## Development

### Backend Development
The backend is a FastAPI application located in `app/backend/`. It uses:
- FastAPI for the web framework
- SQLModel for ORM
- Alembic for database migrations
- Pytest for testing
- Ruff for linting and formatting

### Expo Development
The Expo app is located in `app/expo/` and includes:
- React Native with Expo
- TypeScript
- React Navigation
- TanStack Query for data fetching
- Zustand for state management

## Docker

The project includes Docker Compose configurations for easy deployment:

```bash
# Start all services
docker-compose up -d

# Start with Traefik (production-like)
docker-compose -f docker-compose.traefik.yml up -d
```
